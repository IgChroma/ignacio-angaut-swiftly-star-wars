# Instalation: 
# Steps required:
On the root of the project run htese
```
npm install
npm start
```
Then navigate to http://localhost:1234/

# Notes
Added swapi hooks for better reusability
Fully in react, typescript, using Parcel to run and deploy
Added use memo for performance
Added lint 
I focused on a real star wars experience with multiple planets and star ambient
Sci FI UI

I wanted to add jest, react testing library to add some coverage but ran out of time for this quick demo
Been using jest, RTL, enzyme for UTs as well as webdriver.io or selenium for integration tests

# Live demo
App is deployed here https://igchroma.github.io/ignacio-angaut-swiftly-star-wars/

# Project Overview:
Welcome to our take home interview task! We're excited to see your skills in action. Your
task is to create a directory of characters in the Star Wars universe using the Star Wars
API (https://swapi.dev/) if that doesn’t work please try: https://swapi.info/. The
directory should display each character's name, homeworld name, and species name.
Additionally, it should support easy searching for a person by their name, homeworld,
or species.
This should take between 45-90 minutes. You will have 2 business days to
complete this task.

# Requirements:
● Develop a webpage that presents a grid of character profile cards sourced from
the Star Wars API.
● Utilize the Star Wars API resources:
● People: https://swapi.dev/documentation#people
● Planets: https://swapi.dev/documentation#planets
● Species: https://swapi.dev/documentation#species
● Implement search functionality allowing users to search for characters by name,
homeworld, or species using the search API for each resource.
● Ensure the profile card displays the person’s name, homeworld name, and
species name.
● At the top of the profile page, include a search bar. Render a grid of profile cards
that match the reflected search. If there are no results, show a message stating
there are no results.
● Support both the person’s name, homeworld name, and species as searchable
criteria. Show the results for a person’s name first, then homeworld, then species.
Submission Instructions:
1. Create a public GitHub repository for your project.
2. Utilize the Star Wars API to fetch data for the character directory.
3. Include a README file with instructions for local setup or provide a link to an
instance of the site if deployed.
4. Ensure your code is well-documented and follows best practices.
5. Once you're done, share the repository link with us.

# Additional Notes:
● You have the freedom to design the UI as you see fit.
● Ensure the search functionality is intuitive and efficient for users.

● Consider scalability and maintainability when structuring your code.
● Have fun and showcase your skills! We look forward to seeing your solution.
